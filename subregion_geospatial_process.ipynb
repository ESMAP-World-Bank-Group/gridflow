The goal is to segment each country's territory into spatial subregions using raster data and analyze them in relation to administrative boundaries. Notebook is designed by Jiajia Wang (Jessica) on 07/17/2025.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 1. Setup and Configuration\n","\n","- Import necessary libraries such as `geopandas`, `rioxarray`, `skimage`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.\n","- Define a `base_path` to avoid repeated hardcoding of file paths.\n","- Dynamically construct full paths using `os.path.join()` for better readability and cross-platform compatibility.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Load Country Data\n","\n","- Define a list of countries of interest (e.g., `['ETH', 'SOM', 'KEN']`).\n","- For each country:\n","  - Load its national boundary shapefile.\n","  - Load corresponding solar or wind raster data.\n","  - Store all relevant paths and metadata in a centralized structure (`self.region_data`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Subregion Creation\n","\n","- Use the `RegionSegmentation` class to encapsulate all logic.\n","- The method `create_subregions(n, method)` performs:\n","  - Raster loading (`pv` or `wind` selected via the `method` argument).\n","  - Conversion to NumPy arrays and optional masking of invalid data.\n","  - Segmentation of raster into `n` subregions using `skimage.measure.label()` or similar connected-component analysis.\n","  - Output is a new raster where each pixel is assigned a subregion label.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Load Subregion Point Data\n","\n","- A CSV file containing representative point locations for each generated subregion is loaded using:\n","  ```python\n","  location_file = os.path.join(base_path,
